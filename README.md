**Abstract**
In this paper, we seek to understand the fundamental concept of a cryptocurrency. Although a relatively new and widely misunderstood phenomenon, cryptocurrency, without a doubt has gained stunning popularity since its theoretical proposal, and with this, exponential growth in valuation. We will ﬁrst analyze the structure of a cryptocurrency (in particular, Bitcoin) through the lens of Satashi Nakamoto’s paper on peer-to-peer (P2P) veriﬁcation. In addition, we will unravel the concept of “blockchain” and how computer processing power is used to ensure a secure transaction system. Next, we will provide an in-depth economic evaluation of various cryptocurrencies and attempt to answer the following questions: What is cryptocurrency valued as? Who is investing? Who/What are the major drivers? What are the risks? What are the best strategies? Lastly,we will implement mathematical ﬁnance strategies and algorithms to determine optimal cryptocurrency portfolios and analyze the Markovity of Bear, Bull, and Stagnant market transitions.
